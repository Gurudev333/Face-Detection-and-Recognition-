 Face-Detection-and-Recognition<br/><br/>
•Goal is to detect and recognize face from frame.<br/>
•It works on three modules first module will detects the face with different expressions and save frames with corresponding details about individuals using sqlite database.<br/>
•The Local Binary Patterns Histograms recognizer is used for training the frames. Haar feature based cascade classifier is used. <br/>
•The trained model and corresponding information is used to match with live frame. <br/>
•Libraries used are opencv, numpy, sqlite, and pillow.<br/>
•Execute the modules such that creator, trainner,face_detect_recog.<br/><br/>
I will provid some useful links for better understanding of concepts like OpenCV,face detection, face recognization.<br/>
